### Hi there 👋 ###
My name is Anika, and I'm a senior at UCLA studying Applied Math with a Computing Specialization. Here are some of my favorite projects: 
1. [Pink Tax Checker](https://github.com/anikamisra/pink-tax)
   - My current project where I am analyzing e-commerce data to determine which labels lead to higher prices. 
2. [Chordy](https://github.com/anikamisra/PIC16B-project)
   - A class project in my Python class where we webscraped chord data and generated a program that can play the chord progression of your favorite songs. 
3. [Name Gender Predictor](https://github.com/anikamisra/name-gender-prediction)
   - A personal coding project where I created 4 models that can predict a binary gender based on the name inputted.
